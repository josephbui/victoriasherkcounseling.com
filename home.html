      <h1>Compassionate Mental Health Care in Washington D.C.</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to Victoria Sherk Counseling. I provide
        compassionate and effective mental health care
        and counseling services in
        Washington D.C. As an experienced professional,
        I am dedicated to helping you find the right
        solutions to your mental health needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The decision to seek therapy is a powerful act
        of self-care. Whether you are looking to make a
        major life change, improve a relationship, or
        address significant mental health challenges, I
        am here to listen, provide support,
        and offer honest feedback. I
        like people. I want to hear about your
        experiences, challenges,
        and successes. Reliability,
        honesty, and transparency are
        key qualities of my work. The therapeutic
        relationship is a partnership. You are the
        expert on your life. I bring my 19 years of
        professional experience to assist you in making
        the change you are seeking.
      </p>
      <p>
        I utilize different approaches depending on the
        needs of my clients, though I focus particularly
        on evidence-based interventions such as
        Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and
        mindfulness.
      </p>
      <p>
        I try to provide a welcoming, safe space for
        all races, ethnicities, sexual orientations,
        and gender identities. I seek
        to always consider the impact of my experience
        as a white, cisgender woman on the therapeutic
        relationship, and value open
        communication with my clients about race,
        culture, and gender
        identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        I invite you to contact me for a free initial
        consultation to discuss your interest in
        therapy. I look forward to hearing from
        you.
      </p>

      <h2>ABOUT VICTORIA SHERK</h2>
      <p>
        I am proud to be a native Washingtonian. After
        attending Sarah Lawrence College I moved to San
        Francisco, where I began volunteering with a
        number of community organizations including an
        adult literacy program, a residential program
        for pregnant teens, and the San Francisco Public
        Schools. I was inspired by this work to
        pursue a Master’s degree in Counseling at San
        Francisco State University, which I obtained in
        2003 with concentrations& in Marriage and
        Family Therapy and School Counseling.
        During graduate school I interned at
        neighborhood-based community mental health
        organizations, which solidified my interest in
        working with individuals with persistent mental
        illness in community settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        I returned to Washington in 2004 and began
        working at Community Connections, a core service
        agency for behavioral health services. I worked
        as a therapist, providing Interpersonal
        Psychotherapy for African American women who are
        HIV positive. I also provided treatment
        planning for the agency’s other clients, as well
        as individual clinical supervision towards
        licensure to staff members.
      </p>
      <p>
        I moved to Green Door Behavioral Health (now
        MBI) in 2012. I was ultimately
        appointed as Senior Clinician, where in addition
        to providing therapy, I worked to manage the
        therapy referral system and ensure linkage to
        appropriate clinicians.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2022, I decided to establish my private
        practice. I wanted to build relationships with
        individual clients in addition to couples,
        providing them support as they navigate their
        own mental health journeys.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2017, I was appointed to the DC Board of
        Professional Counseling, and became chair in
        2021. I greatly value the opportunity to
        serve fellow clinicians and residents of the
        District.
